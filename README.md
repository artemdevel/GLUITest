# GLUITest

This is a test project to check how the default Android UI will work with the GLSurfaceView.
The code was derived from the sources listed below. The code was taken from the Google's Samples
because the Samples are quite a big repository and I didn't want to take and compile  everything
from there. The package name, some classes and variables names were changed.

The sources used:
